            <h1>Advice on how to prevent wildfires</h1>
            <p>To prevent wildfires, avoid activities that involve fire or sparks during hot, dry, and windy conditions. Build campfires in safe, open areas and ensure they are fully extinguished before leaving. Properly dispose of smoking materials and maintain vehicles and equipment to prevent sparks.Proper storage of flammable materials, such as gasoline, propane, and other chemicals, is vital in preventing wildfires. Keep these substances in approved containers and store them in well-ventilated areas away from ignition sources. Additionally, ensure that your storage area is secure and inaccessible to children and pets. Safe storage practices can prevent accidental fires and reduce the risk of wildfires.</p>
         

            <h1>Advice on how to protect homes and communities</h1>
            <p>To protect homes and communities from wildfires, use fire-resistant materials for your roof and regularly clear debris from gutters. Create a defensible space of at least 30 feet around your home by removing flammable vegetation and using noncombustible materials. Install metal wire mesh over vents and use multi-pane windows or fireproof shutters to protect against embers and radiant heat. Choose fire-resistant plants for landscaping and maintain your garden by removing dead vegetation. Store flammable materials safely and consider installing external sprinkler systems. Work with your neighbors to develop a community-wide fire prevention plan and participate in local wildfire preparedness programs. These measures can significantly reduce wildfire risks and enhance community safety.</p>
