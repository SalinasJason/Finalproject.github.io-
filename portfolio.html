            <h1>Jason Salinas's Portfolio</h1>
            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Jason Salinas, I'm 20 years old. I'm a student at West Hills College Lemoore and I'm trying to get my full-Stack Web Development certificate. When I was in middle school my class took a 1 week coding program and it caught my attention. Ever since then, I wanted to try to get into coding but things didn't go to plan. This wasn't my first career choice, I went to West Hills College Coalinga and got a certificate in welding technology. When I got my certificate I got a job at The Wonderful Company in Lost Hills. I was welding 10 hours a day Monday through Saturday in the cold and hot. After 6 months I decided that this job wasn't really good for the long run because of how dangerous it was and the side effects you get from inhaling the fumes and smoke from welding. When I saw that West Hills College Lemoore had a coding class I switched my career.</p>
